    While many are searching for peace outside, we believe that world peace MUST begin from each and everyone of us.
    That is why we promote the use of meditation in order to help individuals cultivate peace from within.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open to men of all ethnicities and backgrounds, the European Ordination Program provides the opportunity to
    learn about Buddhism and a monk's way of life. Taking part in the experience will aid in the cultivation of one's
    inner peace.

  <h1 class="text-center mt-5">What is the European Ordination Program?</h1>
  <p>
    The European Ordination Program (EOP) has been established by the vision of Luang Por Dhammajayo, the Abbot of Wat
    Phra Dhammakaya, to introduce Buddhism to the people in The European Union (EU), and others around the world. The
    program was organized for the first time in 2013 at Wat Phra Dhammakaya Benelux, Belgium. Many participants in The
    EU from different countries such a England, Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Italy,
    Malta, Austria, and Switzerland joined the program. When it concluded, all were very satisfied with the program,
    and some even had the intention to join the same kind of program again the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
    The European committee, consisting of 29 branches of Wat Phra Dhammakaya in The EU then decided to organise the
    program every year. Subsequently, more and more participants in The EU have joined the EOP.
  </p>
  <p>
    The EOP provides the opportunity for all the qualified persons in The EU who have interest in studying the Dhamma
    of the Buddha, to use the knowledge they learn and practice from the program to benefit their lives with more
    happiness and prosperity.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the program, all participants have the opportunity to learn about the Theravada Buddhist monk's life, to train
    themselves with the Buddhist disciplines and Buddhist cultures, to practice meditation, to study a variety of
    Buddhist Dhamma topics, and to understand more about the Theravada Buddhist monk's life. The course of study in the
    program has been continuously well-developed from the beginning up until the present, by becoming more efficient
    in training those who are not raised as Buddhists, enabling them to learn and apply the teachings in this short
    period of time after the program is concluded.
  </p>
  <p>
    We therefore would like to invite all qualified persons for The Theravada-Monk Ordination to join the EOP again this
    year. Latest news, announcements, and more information about The EOP is available at all EU branches of Wat Phra
    Dhammakaya, and can also be found on our facebook group
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/EOPBenelux">https://www.facebook.com/groups/EOPBenelux</a>.
