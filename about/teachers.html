        Phra Khru Vithet Sutakom (Luang phi Ronnapop Jotilabho) was born on 24 July 1962. He pursued higher education in
        economics, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Ramkhamhaeng University, Thailand, between 1985 and
        1988. Demonstrating an interest in international opportunities and technology, he later obtained a Master of
        Science in Management Information Systems from Strayer University in the United States (1990–1992). In addition
        to his secular academic background, he achieved recognition as an Advanced Dhamma Scholar in Thailand and passed
        the Pali Scripture Examination Level 3, reflecting his deep commitment to Buddhist scriptural studies.

        On 12 July 1997, he was ordained as a Buddhist monk by the Most Venerable Phra Phrom Wachirapanyajarn, the Abbot
        of Wat Ratcha Orasaram Ratchaworawihan, a prestigious royal temple in Bangkok, Thailand. This marked the
        beginning of his dedicated monastic life within the Dhammakaya Foundation and its international outreach.
        Shortly after ordination, he served as a Mentor Monk in the Thai Dhammadayada Training Program from 1997 to
        1998. He quickly took on roles in communication and media, heading the Internet Division of the Communication
        Department from 1999 to 2001. From 2002 to 2017, he contributed significantly as a Teaching Monk in the
        International Dhammadayada Training Program and as Head of the Dhamma Media Foreign Language Division, helping
        spread Buddhist teachings globally through multilingual media and training initiatives.
        In 2010, he was appointed Assistant Director of the International Affairs Department at the Dhammakaya
        Foundation in Thailand. A position he continues to hold today, overseeing international relations and outreach
        efforts.

        Since 2019, he has served as the Abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya London in the United Kingdom, where he also acts
        as a Meditation Instructor. In this capacity, he leads the temple community, guides practitioners in Dhammakaya
