    While many are searching for peace outside, we believe that world peace MUST begin from each and everyone of us.
    That is why we promote the use of meditation in order to help individuals cultivate peace from within.

    Open to people of all ethnicities and backgrounds, the European Ordination Programme provides the opportunity to
    learn about Buddhism and a monk's way of life. Taking part in the experience will aid in the cultivation of one's
    inner peace.
